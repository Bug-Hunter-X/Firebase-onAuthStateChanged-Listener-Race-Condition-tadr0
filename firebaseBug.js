The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener may not trigger as expected if the user's authentication state changes rapidly, such as during a sequence of login/logout attempts in quick succession.  This can lead to race conditions and inconsistencies in your application's state management.  Consider a scenario where a user logs in, then logs out within milliseconds. The listener might miss the logout event.
